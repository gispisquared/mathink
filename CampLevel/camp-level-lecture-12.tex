\section{Comments}
Even though sequence problems and integer function problems look cosmetically
different, a sequence is just a function from $\Nn$ to (some subset of) $\Rr$.

For divisibility problems, try to make one side of the divisibility prime.

If you can find infinitely many values, often you can sub a small unknown number
and a large known one, and this gives you the small number.
\section{Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Find all completely multiplicative functions $f:\mathbb N\to\mathbb R$
    such that for all $a,b\in\mathbb N$, at least two of $f(a),f(b),f(a+b)$ are
    equal.
  \item Find all functions $f:\Nn\to\Nn$ such that $f(n+1)>f(f(n))$ for all
    positive integers $n$.
  \item Does there exist a strictly increasing function $f:\Nn\to\Nn$ such that
    $f(1)=2$ and $f(f(n))=f(n)+n$ for all positive integers $n$?
  \item Prove that all terms of the sequence $a_1=a_2=a_3=1,\
    a_{n+1}=(1+a_{n-1}a_n)/a_{n+2}$ are integers.
  \item Does there exist a strictly increasing function $f:\Nn\to\Nn$ such that
    $f(mn)=f(m)+f(n)$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$?
  \item Let $f:\Zz\to\Nn$ be a function such that for any integers $m$ and $n$,
    $f(m-n)\mid f(m)-f(n)$. Prove that for all integers $m$ and $n$, if $f(m)\le
    f(n)$ then $f(m)\mid f(n)$.
  \item Let $P(n)$ be the product of the digits of a positive integer $n$.
    Let $n_1$ be a positive integer, and define $n_{i+1}=n_i+P(n_i)$ for each
    $i\ge 1$. Prove that this sequence is eventually constant.
  \item Find all functions $f:\Zz_{\ge 0}\to \Zz_{\ge 0}$ such that
    $f(f(f(n)))=f(n+1)+1$ for all $n\in\Zz_{\ge 0}$.
  \item Let $a_1,a_2,\ldots$ be a sequence of integers such that the average of
    every consecutive group of $a_i$s is a perfect square. Prove that the
    sequence is constant.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Homework}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Is there a sequence $a_1,\ldots,a_n$ of primes such that for each $i$ we
    have $10 a_i\le a_{i+1}<10a_i+9$?
  \item Find all functions $f:\Nn\to\Nn$ such that $m^2+f(n)\mid
    mf(m)+n$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$.
  \item Is there a function $f:\Nn\to\Nn$ of positive integers such that
    $\gcd(a_m,a_n)=1\iff |m-n|=1$?
\end{enumerate}
