\section{Techniques}
\begin{itemize}
	\item WLOG arguments: break symmetry to bound one of the variables.
	\item If $a$ and $b$ are integers with $a>b$ then $a\ge b+1$.
	\item If $a$ and $b$ are integers with $b\ne 0$ and $a\mid b$ then
	      $|a|\le|b|$. Thus, try to get big dividing small.
	\item Look for ``dominant terms'' that grow larger than everything else.
	\item A concave down function on a closed interval
	      achieves its minimum at one of the endpoints.
	\item Hierarchy of size: let $P(n)$ and $Q(n)$ be non-constant polynomials such that $\deg
		      P>\deg Q$, and let $c>1$ be a constant. For sufficiently large $n$,
	      $\ln n<|Q(n)|<|P(n)|< c^n< n!< n^n$. In fact, the ratio of successive
	      terms goes to $0$ as $n$ goes to $\infty$.
	\item Stirling's Approximation: $\left(\frac ne\right)^n<n!<n\left(\frac
		      ne\right)^n$.
	\item Bernoulli's Inequality: for $r\ge 1$ and $x\ge -1$ we have $(1+x)^r\ge
		      1+rx$.
\end{itemize}
\section{Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Prove that for any real polynomial $P$ such that the leading coefficient
	      of $P$ is positive, there is an $N$ such that for any $n>N$, $P(n)>0$.
	\item Find all pairs $x,y$ of positive integers such that $3^x-8^y=2xy+1$.
	\item Find all pairs of positive integers $x,y$ such that
	      $1+2^x+2^{2x}=y^2$.
	\item Prove that for any real numbers $c>1$ and $x>0$, and any polynomial $P$,
	      there is an $N$ such that for any $n>N$, $c^n>P(n)$.
	\item Find all pairs of positive integers $x,y$ such that
	      $1+2^x+2^{2x+1}=y^2$.
	\item Find all pairs of positive integers $x,y$ such that $x^3-y^3=xy+61$.
	\item Find all triples of positive integers $a,b,c$ such that $a^2+b+c=abc$.
	\item Find all positive integers $x,y,n$ such that $\gcd(x,n+1)=1$ and
	      $x^n+1=y^{n+1}$.
	\item Four positive integers $x,y,z,t$ satisfy $xy-zt=x+y=z+t$. Is it possible
	      that $xy$ and $zt$ are both perfect squares?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Homework}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Does there exist an integer $n>1$ such that all powers of $n$ are
	      base-10 palindromes?
	\item Find all pairs of positive integers $x,y$ such that $xy^2+y+7\mid
		      x^2y+x+y$.
	\item Find all triples $a,b,c$ of positive integers such that
	      $a^3+b^3+c^3=(abc)^2$.
