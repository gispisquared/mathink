\section{Techniques}
  There is really one technique here: assign some positive integer quantity
  (the ``size'' of a solution, e.g.\ the sum of the absolute valies of the
  variables) to each solution, take the solution with lowest
  ``size'' that doesn't fit your claimed pattern and derive a contradiction.
\section{Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Find all solutions in integers to $a^3+3b^3+9c^3=0$.
  \item Find all solutions in integers to $a^4+b^4=c^2$.
  \item Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers.
    Prove that if \(\frac{a^2+b^2}{ab+1}\) is an integer, then it is a square.
  \item Pell Equations:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Let $d$ be a positive integer which is not a perfect square. Prove that
      there exist positive integers $x_0,y_0$ such that for any pair $x,y$ of
      positive integers satisfying $x^2-dy^2=1$, there is a positive integer $k$
      satisfying
      \[x+y\sqrt d=(x_0+y_0\sqrt d)^k.\]
      \item Find the recurrence relating a solution $(x_n,y_n)$ to the next
        solution $(x_{n+1},y_{n+1})$.
      \item Do the same for $x^2-dy^2=-1$.
    \end{itemize}
    In the case where the RHS is 1, it is known that there is always a solution.
    When the RHS
    is $-1$, there need not be solutions (eg $x^2-3y^2=-1$ has no solutions).
  \item Prove that there are infinitely many triples $(a,b,c)$ of positive
    integers in arithmetic progression
    such that $ab+1$, $bc+1$ and $ca+1$ are all perfect squares.
  \item Find all solutions in integers to $x^2+y^2+z^2=2xyz$.
  \item Let $a$ and $b$ be two positive integers. Prove that
    \[a^2+\left\lceil\frac{4a^2}b\right\rceil\] is not a square.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Homework}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item We call a 5-tuple of integers \emph{arrangeable} if its elements can be
      labelled $a,b,c,d,e$ in some order such that $a-b+c-d+e=0$. Determine all
      2022-tuples of integers such that if we place them in order around a
      circle, then any 5-tuple of numbers in consecutive positions is
      arrangeable.
    \item Find all positive integers $n$ such that \[\sqrt{\frac{7^n+1}2}\] is
      prime.
    \item Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers. Show that if $4ab-1$ divides
      $(4a^2-1)^2$, then $a=b$.
  \end{enumerate}
