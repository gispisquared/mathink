\section{Techniques}
  Density arguments: these involve taking a ``global'' view that involves
  estimating how many numbers have a specific property in a specific range.
  The aim is usually to apply pigeonhole.

  Floor functions: recall $\lfloor x\rfloor$ is the largest integer which is at
  most $x$. Most often, problems which involve $\lfloor x\rfloor$ will be
  solved by considering $x-\lfloor x\rfloor$ (also denoted $\{x\}$), or $\lceil
  x\rceil-x$.
\section{Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Is there a positive integer which can be written as the sum of 2023
    distinct 2022nd powers in at least 2021 different ways?
  \item Let $a$ and $b$ be irrational numbers such that $\frac 1a+\frac 1b=1$.
    Let $A=\{\lfloor na\rfloor: n\in\mathbb N\}$, and $B=\{\lfloor nb\rfloor:
    n\in\mathbb N\}$. Prove that $A\cap B=\emptyset$ and $A\cup B=\mathbb N$.
  \item Prove that every positive integer is the root of a polynomial all of whose
    coefficients are of the form $2^a-2^b$ for positive integers $a$ and $b$.
  \item Let $p$ and $q$ be coprime. Prove that
    \[\sum_{i=1}^{q-1}\left\lfloor\frac{ip}{q}\right\rfloor=\frac{(p-1)(q-1)}2.\]
  \item Find all positive integers $n$ such that $1+\lfloor\sqrt n\rfloor$
    divides $n$.
  \item Let $r$ be an irrational root of a polynomial $P(x)$ of degree $d$ with
    integer coefficients. Prove that there is a real number $C$ such that for
    any integer $q$ we have $\{qr\}\ge \frac C{q^{d-1}}$.
  \item Let $x$ be an irrational number. Prove that there are infinitely many
    positive integers $n$ such that $\{nx\}<\frac 1n$.
  \item Prove that the sequence $a_i=\left\lfloor(\sqrt 2+1)^i\right\rfloor$
    alternates between even and odd integers.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Homework}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Define the sequence $a_0=i,\ a_{n+1}=a_n\lfloor a_n\rfloor$ for each
      nonnegative integer $n$. For which positive integers $i$ does there exist a
      positive integer $k$ such that $a_k$ is a positive integer?
    \item Let $n>1$ be an integer, and let $a$ be an integer coprime to $n$. Prove
      that there exist integers $x,y$ with $0<|x|<\sqrt n$, $0<|y|<\sqrt n$ and
      $ay\equiv x\pmod n$.
    \item Prove that for some constant $C>0$, the following statement holds:

      Let $m\ge 2$ be an integer, $A$ a finite set of integers (not
      necessarily positive), and $B_1,B_2,\ldots,B_m$ subsets of $A$. Suppose
      that for every $k=1,2,\ldots,m$, the sum of the elements of $B_k$ is
      $2^k$. Then $A$ contains at least $\frac {Cm}{\log_2 m}$ elements.
