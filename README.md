Number theory lectures for Mathink.
There are 2 levels of lectures: senior level is the lower level, aiming at
regional contests like the AIMO, ASC and AMO, while camp level is the higher
level, aiming at harder AMO/ASC questions and the team selection tests.
Each level contains 12 lectures, divided into 3 terms of 4 lectures each.
Advanced material which didn't fit into either level goes into the team level
document; this is targeted at the level of an IMO team member.
