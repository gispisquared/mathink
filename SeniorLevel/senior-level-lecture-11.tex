\section{Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Prove that there does not exist a function $f:\Nn\to\Nn$
    such that for any distinct positive integers $i$ and $j$,
    $\gcd(f(i)+j,f(j)+i)=1$.
  \item Find all functions $f:\Zz\to\Zz$ such that $f(m+f(n))=f(m)-n$ for all
    integers $m$ and $n$.
  \item Consider a sequence of positive integers $a_1,a_2,\ldots$ which satisfies
    $a_n=a_{n-1}^2+a_{n-2}^2+a_{n-3}^2$ for all $n\ge 3$. Prove that if
    $a_k=1997$ then $k\le 4$.
  \item Prove that any infinite sequence of integers in arithmetic progression has an
    infinite subsequence in geometric progression.
  \item Prove that there exists an increasing sequence $\{a_n\}_1^\infty$
    of positive integers such that for any $k\ge 0$, the sequence $\{k+a_n\}$
    contains only finitely many primes.
  \item Prove that the function $f(n)=\lfloor(1+\sqrt 2)^n\rfloor$ alternates
    between even and odd integers.
  \item The sequence $\{a_i\}_1^\infty$ is defined by $a_1 = 1$ and
    $a_{n+1}=a_n^2+1$ for $n\ge 1$. Prove that there are infinitely many primes
    which divide some $a_i$.
  \item Let $n$ be a positive integer. Define a sequence by letting $a_1=n$, and
    for each $i>1$ choosing $a_i$ such that $0\le a_i<i$ and
    $\frac{a_1+\cdots+a_i}i$ is an integer. Prove that this sequence is
    eventually constant.

\section{Homework}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Find all functions $f:\Nn\to\Nn$ satisfying $f(n+f(n))=f(n)$ for all
    $n$ such that 1 is in the range of $f$.
  \item Find all monotonically increasing functions $f:\Nn\to\Zz_{\ge 0}$ such that $f(mn)=f(m)+f(n)$ for
    all nonnegative integers $m$ and $n$.
  \item Let $a,b$ be odd positive integers. Define the sequence $c_n$ by
    choosing $c_1=a,c_2=b$ and for each $i>2$ letting $c_i$ be the largest odd
    divisor of $c_{i-1}+c_{i-2}$. Prove that this sequence is eventually
    constant
    (that is, there is an $m$ such that for any $i,j>m$, $a_i=a_j$).
