\section{Lecture 10 Homework}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Prove that for any positive integer $c$ and any prime $p$, there is a
    positive integer $x$ such that $x^x\equiv c\pmod p$.
  \item Let $x$ be an irrational number, and let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers
    such that $0\le a<b\le 1$. Prove that there is an integer $n$ such that
    $a<\{nx\}<b$. Hence prove that there is a power of $2$ whose decimal
    representation starts with $2023$.
  \item Prove that every arithmetic progression $a,a+b,\ldots$ where
    $\gcd(a,b)=1$ has infinitely many terms which are not divisible by any
    perfect square larger than $1$.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Lecture 11 Homework}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Find all functions $f:\Nn\to\Nn$ such that $f(f(m)f(n))=mn$ for all
    positive integers $m$ and $n$.
  \item Find all monotonically increasing functions $f:\Nn\to\Zz_{\ge 0}$ such that $f(mn)=f(m)+f(n)$ for
    all nonnegative integers $m$ and $n$.
  \item Let $a,b$ be odd positive integers. Define the sequence $c_n$ by
    choosing $c_1=a,c_2=b$ and for each $i>2$ letting $c_i$ be the largest odd
    divisor of $c_{i-1}+c_{i-2}$. Prove that this sequence is eventually
    constant
    (that is, there is an $m$ such that for any $i,j>m$, $a_i=a_j$).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Homework}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The denominators of two irreducible fractions are 600 and 700. Find the
    minimum value of the denominator of their sum (written as an irreducible
    fraction).
  \item We call the \emph{main divisors} of a composite number $n$ the two
    largest of its divisors other than $n$. Composite numbers $a$ and $b$ are
    such that their main divisors coincide. Prove that $a=b$.
  \item Suppose $a_1,a_2, \dots$ is an infinite strictly increasing sequence of
    positive integers and $p_1, p_2, \dots$ is a sequence of distinct primes
    such that $p_n \mid a_n$ for all $n \ge 1$. It turned out that
    $a_n-a_k=p_n-p_k$ for all $n,k \ge 1$. Prove that the sequence $\{a_n\}$
    consists only of prime numbers.
