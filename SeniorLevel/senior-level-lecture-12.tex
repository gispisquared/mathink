\section{Basic facts}
For all of these, let $p(x)=\sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^i$ be a polynomial with integer
coefficients. 

We say that $p(x)$ is \emph{divisible} by a polynomial $q(x)$ if there is a
polynomial $r(x)$ (not necessarily with integer coefficients) such that
$p(x)=q(x)r(x)$. We also write $q(x)\mid p(x)$.
\begin{itemize}
  \item (Division algorithm) For any polynomial $q$ there are unique
    polynomials $f$ and $r$ such that $p(x)=q(x)f(x)+r$ and $\deg R<\deg q$.

    If $q$ has integer coefficients, then $f$ and $r$ have rational
    coefficients. If $q$ has a leading coefficient of $\pm 1$, then $f$ and $r$
    have integer coefficients.
  \item (Factor theorem) If $a$ is a root of $p$, then $x-a\mid p(x)$.
  \item (Remainder theorem) If $p(a)=c$ then $x-a\mid p(x)-c$.
  \item (*) If $a$ and $b$ are integers, then $a-b\mid p(a)-p(b)$.
  \item (Finite differences) If $c$ is a constant and $p$ is a polynomial with
    leading coefficient $ax^n$, then $p(x)-p(x-c)$ is a polynomial with
    leading coefficient $nax^{n-1}$.
  \item (Rational Root Theorem) If $y$ and $z$ are integers with $\gcd(y,z)=1$
    such that $p(y/z)=0$ then $y\mid a_0$ and $z\mid a_n$.
\end{itemize}
\section{Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Prove that every nonconstant integer polynomial has a composite number
    in its image.
  \item Do there exist two quadratics $ax^2+bx+c$ and $(a+1)x^2+(b+1)x+(c+1)$
    which both have two integer roots?
  \item Let $P$ be an integer polynomial such that if $P(x)$ is an integer then
    $x$ is rational. Prove that $P$ is linear.
  \item Find all polynomials $P(x)$ with integer coefficients such that if
    $m\mid n$ then $P(m)\mid P(n)$.
  \item Prove that for any two distinct polynomials $P$ and $Q$ with coefficients in
    $\{0,1,\ldots,9\}$, either $P(-2)\ne Q(-2)$ or $P(-5)\ne Q(-5)$.
  \item Let $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ be polynomials with integer coefficients such that the
    leading coefficient of $P(x)$ is 1. Suppose that $P(n)^n$ divides $Q(n)^{n+1}$ for infinitely
    many positive integers $n$.
    Prove that $P(n)$ divides $Q(n)$ for infinitely many positive integers $n$.
  \item Let $n\ge 2$ be an integer and
    $P(x)$ be a polynomial with nonnegative integer coefficients satisfying
    $P(1)=1$ and $x^n P(1/x)=P(x)$ for all $x$.
    Prove that there exist infinitely many
    pairs $x, y$ of positive integers such that $x|P(y)$ and $y|P(x)$.
  \item  Given are positive integers $a, b$ satisfying $a \geq 2b$. Does there
    exist a polynomial $P(x)$ of degree at least $1$ with coefficients from the
    set $\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, b-1 \}$ such that $P(b) \mid P(a)$?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Homework}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Prove that if $P$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients and leading term $a_0n^k$ such
    that $m\mid P(n)$ for all $n$, then $m\mid k!a_0$.
  \item Prove that for every polynomial $P(x)$ of degree at least 2 with integer
    coefficients, there is an infinite arithmetic
    progression of integers which does not contain $P(k)$ for any integer $k$.
  \item Is there a polynomial $f$ of degree $2023$ with integer
    coefficients such that \[f(n), f(f(n)), f(f(f(n))), \cdots\] are pairwise
    relatively prime for any integer $n$?
