\section{Choosing good mods}
  Prove that:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Squares are 0, 1 or 4 mod each of \{5,8\}, and 0 or 1 mod 3.
    \item Cubes are 0, 1 or $-1$ mod each of \{7,9\}.
  \end{itemize}
  Often a problem will be solved by considering it under an appropriate mod.
  In general, for $n$th powers, try looking mod $m$ where $\varphi(m)$ is a
  small multiple of $n$.
  You can also try choosing a mod which divides a bunch of terms in an
  equation.

  However, remember that if you find a single solution to an equation, then that
  solution is still a solution in every mod so you won't be able to find a
  contradiction.
\section{Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Find all positive integers $a,b$ such that $a^4+b^4=10a^2b^2-2022$.
  \item Find all positive integers $n$ such that $2^n+7^n$ is a perfect square.
  \item Find all pairs of positive integers $x,y$ such that $x!+5=y^3$.
  \item Find all primes $p,q$ for which $pq\mid (5^p-2^p)(5^q-2^q)$.
  \item Prove that if $p$ is prime, then $2^p+3^p$ is not a nontrivial perfect
    power.
  \item Find all positive integers $x,y,z$ such that $3^x+4^y=5^z$.
  \item Find all integers $a,b$ such that $a^3+(a+1)^3+\cdots+(a+6)^3=b^4+1$.
  \item What is the least residue mod $n$ of the product of the elements of
    $\mathbb Z_n^*$?
