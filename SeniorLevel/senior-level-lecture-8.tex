\section{Techniques}
Descent works like this: assign some positive integer quantity
(the ``size'' of a solution, e.g.\ the sum of the absolute values of the
variables) to each solution, take the solution with lowest
``size'' that doesn't fit your claimed pattern and derive a contradiction.

Floor functions: recall $\lfloor x\rfloor$ is the largest integer which is at
most $x$. Most often, problems which involve $\lfloor x\rfloor$ will be
solved by considering $x-\lfloor x\rfloor$ (also denoted $\{x\}$), or $\lceil
	x\rceil-x$, and doing inequalities.
\section{Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Prove that $\lfloor\sqrt n+\sqrt{n+1}\rfloor=\lfloor\sqrt{4n+1}\rfloor$ for all
	      positive integers $n$.
	\item Prove that if $x, y, z$ are integers such that $x^2+y^2+z^2=(xy)^2$,
	      then $x=y=z=0$.
	\item Let $a$ and $b$ be positive irrational numbers such that $\frac 1a+\frac 1b=1$.
	      Let $A=\{\lfloor na\rfloor: n\in\mathbb N\}$, and $B=\{\lfloor nb\rfloor:
		      n\in\mathbb N\}$. Prove that the sets $A$ and $B$ together contain each
	      posiive integer exactly once.
	\item Let $f$ be a function defined on the nonnegative integers such that
	      $f(2x)=2f(x)$, $f(4x+1)=4f(x)+3$, and $f(4x-1)=2f(2x-1)-1$. Prove that $f$
	      is injective.
	\item Find all positive integers $n$ such that $1+\lfloor\sqrt n\rfloor$
	      divides $n$.
	\item Solve over integers: $6(6a^2 + 3b^2 + c^2) = 5n^2$.
	\item Prove that for any positive integer $n$ which is not a perfect square,
	      there is a positive integer $k$ such that
	      \[n=\left\lfloor k+\sqrt k+\frac12\right\rfloor.\]
\end{enumerate}

\section{Homework}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let's say you have a set $S$ of positive rational numbers such that
	      $1\in S$, and if $x\in S$ then both $x+1$ and $\frac 1x$ are in $S$. Prove
	      that $S$ contains all positive rationals.
	\item Let $p$ and $q$ be coprime. Prove that
	      \[\sum_{i=1}^{q-1}\left\lfloor\frac{ip}{q}\right\rfloor=\frac{(p-1)(q-1)}2.\]
	\item Prove that there does not exist a list of $2022$ positive integers
	      such that if you remove any one of them, the rest can be split into two
	      groups of equal sum.
