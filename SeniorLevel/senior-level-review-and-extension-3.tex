\section{Key concepts for this term}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Bounding: WLOG, dominant terms, induction, mods.
    \item Descent
    \item How to deal with floor functions
    \item Diophantine equations: factorisations, mods, discriminant, taking out
      GCD\@.
  \end{itemize}
\section{Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Find all pairs of positive integers $x,y$ such that $x^3+y^3=(x+y)^2$.
  \item Find all pairs of positive integers $x,y$ such that
    $1+2^x+2^{2x}=y^2$.
  \item Find all pairs of positive integers $x,y$ such that $x!+5=y^3$.
  \item Find all positive integers $n$ such that $1+\lfloor\sqrt n\rfloor$
    divides $n$.
  \item Prove that for any positive integer $n$ which is not a perfect square,
    there is a positive integer $k$ such that
    \[n=\left\lfloor n+\sqrt n+\frac12\right\rfloor.\]
  \item Let $d$ be a positive integer which is not a perfect square. Prove that
      there exist positive integers $x_0,y_0$ such that for any pair $x,y$ of
      positive integers satisfying $x^2-dy^2=1$, there is a positive integer $k$
      satisfying
      \[x+y\sqrt d=(x_0+y_0\sqrt d)^k.\]
  \item Prove that there are infinitely many positive integers which are not the
    sum of a square and a prime.
  \item Find all pairs of integers $x,y$ such that $x^4+2x^2y+y^3=0$.
  \item Prove that the equation $y^2=x^3+7$ has no integer solutions.
